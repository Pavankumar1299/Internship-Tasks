**Expected Outcome**
The webpage should display a basic layout structure created using div elements. It is expected to have a header at the top, a navigation bar below it, a main content section in the center, and a footer at the bottom. Box model properties such as margin, padding, and border should be clearly visible and affect the spacing and appearance of each section.

**Actual Outcome:**
The webpage was successfully created with separate sections for header, navbar, content, and footer using div elements. The box model properties were applied correctly, resulting in proper spacing between elements. Padding increased internal spacing, margins controlled the distance between sections, and borders clearly defined each area of the layout.
