**Expected Outcome:**
I expected the webpage to have a clean background, readable text, and a styled button instead of the plain default HTML look. I also expected margin, padding, and borders to create proper spacing and separation between elements.

**Actual Outcome:**
The webpage displayed a light background color with a centered white container. Text appeared with custom fonts and colors, spacing looked neat due to margin and padding, and the button had color, rounded corners, and a hover effect. The page looked structured and visually appealing compared to raw HTML.
