**Expected Outcome**
The webpage should adjust smoothly to different screen sizes.
Cards should be displayed in three columns on desktop screens with proper spacing between them.
On smaller screens (mobile view), the cards should stack vertically, occupy full width, and remain readable without horizontal scrolling.
Buttons and text should remain clear and usable on all devices.

**Actual Outcome**
The webpage layout adjusts correctly based on screen size using percentage widths and media queries.
On desktop view, three cards appear in a row with visible gaps between them using Flexbox gap.
On mobile view (below 600px), the cards stack vertically and take 100% width.
The design remains clean, responsive, and visually balanced across screen sizes.
