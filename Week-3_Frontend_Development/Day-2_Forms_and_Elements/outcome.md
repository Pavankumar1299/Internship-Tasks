# Outcome
**Expected Outcome**
The expected outcome was to understand how HTML forms work and to create a basic registration form that collects user information such as name, email, phone number, password, and gender using appropriate input elements and labels.

**Actual Outcome**
A fully functional registration form was successfully created using HTML. Proper labels were associated with each input field, correct input types were used (text, email, tel, password, radio), and basic form validation was implemented using the required attribute.
