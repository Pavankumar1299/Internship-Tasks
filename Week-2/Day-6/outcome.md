##  Day 6 – Mini Practice Programs

### 1. Student Management System

**Expected Outcome:**
To create a menu-driven program that can add, view, update, and delete student records using functions and data structures.

**Actual Outcome:**
Successfully implemented a student management system using lists/dictionaries and functions. The program correctly handled user input and performed CRUD operations through a menu.

### 2. Calculator Using Functions

**Expected Outcome:**
To perform basic arithmetic operations using user-defined functions and control flow.

**Actual Outcome:**
Implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using separate functions. The calculator worked correctly with menu selection and handled division by zero safely.

### 3. Menu-Driven Program

**Expected Outcome:**
To understand how loops and conditional statements can be used to repeatedly display options and execute user-selected tasks.

**Actual Outcome:**
Created multiple menu-driven programs (general menu and food ordering system). The loop executed continuously until the exit option was selected, and each menu option worked as expected.

### 4. File-Based Record System

**Expected Outcome:**
To store and retrieve records from a file and understand file handling operations.

**Actual Outcome:**
Successfully wrote records to a text file and read them back. Implemented duplicate-record checking by reading existing file contents before appending new data.

### 5. Dictionary Application

**Expected Outcome:**
To store word–meaning pairs and retrieve meanings efficiently using a dictionary.

**Actual Outcome:**
Implemented a dictionary application that allowed adding new words and searching for meanings using Python’s `dict` data structure.
