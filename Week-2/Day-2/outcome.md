# Outcome: Day-2 Dictionaries & Sets
## Create Dictionary of Student Details

**Expected Outcome:**
You should understand how to create a dictionary using key–value pairs, access values using keys, and store structured data like student information.

**Actual Outcome:**
Successfully created dictionaries to store student details such as name, age, course, and marks. Learned how to retrieve specific values using keys and understood how dictionaries store data in a structured format.

## Add, Update, and Delete Elements

**Expected Outcome:**
You should be able to modify dictionaries dynamically by adding new key–value pairs, updating existing values, and removing unwanted entries.

**Actual Outcome:**
Practiced adding new fields like city, updating marks, and deleting fields using del and pop(). Understood the difference between removing safely and directly deleting keys.

## Count Word Frequency Using Dictionary

**Expected Outcome:**
You should understand how dictionaries can be used for counting and tracking occurrences of items (very common interview problem).

**Actual Outcome:**
Implemented word frequency logic using loops and condition checking. Also explored a cleaner, professional approach using Counter from collections. Gained clarity on real-world usage like analytics, logs, and text processing.

## Perform Set Operations

**Expected Outcome:**
You should understand how sets handle unique elements and how to perform union, intersection, difference, and other operations.

**Actual Outcome:**
Practiced union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, subset, superset, and disjoint checks. Understood how sets automatically remove duplicates and are useful for comparison-based logic.
