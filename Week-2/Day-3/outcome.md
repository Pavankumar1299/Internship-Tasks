# Outcome: Day-3 Strings & Operations
## Reverse a String

**Expected Outcome:**
You should understand how to reverse a string using loops and slicing, and learn how string indexing works.

**Actual Outcome:**
Successfully reversed strings using both loop-based logic and slicing ([::-1]). Understood how indexing from the end works and why strings are immutable.

## Check Palindrome

**Expected Outcome:**
You should be able to check whether a given string is a palindrome using logical comparison techniques.

**Actual Outcome:**
Implemented palindrome checking using the two-pointer approach and verified results correctly. Learned how to compare characters from both ends of the string efficiently.

## Count Vowels and Consonants

**Expected Outcome:**
You should be able to count vowels and consonants in a string while ignoring spaces and non-alphabetic characters.

**Actual Outcome:**
Successfully counted vowels and consonants using conditional checks. Understood how to filter characters and handle case sensitivity.

## Character Frequency

**Expected Outcome:**
You should understand how to count the frequency of each character in a string using a dictionary.

**Actual Outcome:**
Practiced calculating character frequency using dictionaries and the get() method. Learned how dictionaries help in mapping characters to counts efficiently.

## String Slicing

**Expected Outcome:**
You should understand how to extract parts of a string using slicing with start, end, and step values.

**Actual Outcome:**
Practiced multiple slicing patterns including skipping characters, extracting substrings, and reversing strings. Understood that the end index is always excluded and how step affects traversal.
