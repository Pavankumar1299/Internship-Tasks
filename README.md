Daily Internship Tasks

## Week-1 Python Programming
### Day-1 Orientation & Internship Overview
The internship structure, objectives, and expected outcomes were explained in detail. Python and a suitable code editor were installed, and a GitHub account along with an internship repository was created. This helped in understanding the workflow and daily submission process using GitHub.

### Day-2 Introduction to Python & Basic Syntax
Basic Python programs were written to print personal details and perform arithmetic operations. This activity helped in understanding Python syntax, input-output statements, and executing simple programs.

### Day-3 Conditional Statements
Programs were developed using conditional statements to check even or odd numbers, find the largest of three numbers, and determine pass or fail based on marks. This improved logical thinking and decision-making skills in Python.

### Day-4 Loops
Programs using `for` and `while` loops were implemented, including multiplication tables and star pattern programs. This day focused on understanding repetition and iteration in Python programming.

### Day-5 Functions & Code Reusability
Functions were written for arithmetic operations, factorial calculation, and prime number checking. This helped in learning modular programming and code reusability.

### Day-6 Practice & Logic Building
Multiple logical problems were solved, and existing programs were debugged and corrected. This practice strengthened problem-solving skills and improved confidence in Python fundamentals.

### Day-7 Assessment & Assignment Submission
All Week-1 Python programs were reviewed, finalized, and uploaded to GitHub with outputs and outcomes. This ensured proper documentation and successful submission of the Python basics assignment.


## Week-2 Advanced Python Programming
### Day-1 Python Lists & Tuples
Programs were written to create and display lists, find the largest and smallest elements, and sort lists in ascending and descending order. Lists were also converted into tuples, helping in understanding mutable and immutable data structures in Python.

### Day-2 Dictionaries & Sets
Dictionary programs were implemented to store student details and perform add, update, and delete operations. Word frequency counting using dictionaries and basic set operations were performed to understand key–value pairs and set behavior.

### Day-3 Strings & Operations
String manipulation programs were developed to reverse strings, check for palindromes, count vowels and consonants, find character frequency, and perform string slicing. This improved understanding of string handling and text processing in Python.

### Day-4 File Handling
File handling programs were created to write, read, and append data to files. Student records were stored and retrieved using files, which helped in understanding persistent data storage in Python.

### Day-5 Exception Handling
Programs using try–except blocks were written to handle runtime errors such as division by zero and file-related issues. Custom exceptions were also implemented to manage user-defined error conditions.

### Day-6 Mini Practice Programs
Mini projects such as a student management system, calculator using functions, menu-driven programs, file-based record systems, and dictionary applications were developed. These programs helped in applying multiple Python concepts together.

### Day-7 Assessment & Submission
All Week-2 programs were finalized, uploaded to GitHub, and documented with output screenshots along with expected and actual outcomes. This ensured proper evaluation and completion of Week-2 internship tasks.


## Week-3 Frontend Development
### Day-1 Introduction to HTML
a basic static web page was designed using HTML. Different HTML tags were used to structure content, display images, create lists, add links, and present data in a tabular format. The experiment helped in understanding how HTML elements work together to form a complete web page.

### Day-2 Forms & Input Elements
Today’s task focused on building an HTML registration form. The form was structured using the <form> tag, user inputs were collected through various <input> elements, and accessibility was improved by linking labels with form controls. The form layout was kept simple and readable.
